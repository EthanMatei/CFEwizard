Cohort Creation
=============================

The following cohorts need to be created:

1. Discovery Cohort
2. Clinical Chort (previously referred to as the Validation Cohort)
3. Testing Cohort - consists of the following 3 subgroups, which may overlap:
    * State (test)
    * First year
    * Future (hospitalization)

Discovery Cohort Creation
-----------------------------

1. Display the list of phene tables (or all tables if the phene tables cannot be distinguished).
2. The user selects the table, and then the phenes in that table are displayed
3. The user selects the phene
4. The user specifies low and high cutoffs (use less-than-or-equal and greater-than-or-equal)

Notes:
* Microarray data table is used to limit the subjects in the cohort to those for which there is gene expression data
* In the Cohort table, the date is the date of the visit corresponding to the PhenVisit field
