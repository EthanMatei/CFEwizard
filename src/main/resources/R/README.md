R 3.5.3 is what is used to run the stand alone R scripts that are run on Windows.

The Windows versions of the scripts used the RODBC package for accessing MS Access, but
this package is not available on Linux.

The .jar (Java ARchive) files in this directory are needed by R when using the JDBC driver to
access MS Access databases.
